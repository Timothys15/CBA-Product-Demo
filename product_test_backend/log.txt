Technology	
makes	
it	
surprisingly	
easy	
for	
companies	
to	
keep	
close	
track	
of	
their	
workforces	
,	
obtaining	
incredible	
detail	
on	
employee	
behaviors	
and	
interactions	
.	
Yet	
no	
employer	
wants	
to	
be	
known	
for	
putting	
its	
employees	
under	
“	
surveillance	
.	
”	
Balancing	
the	
inherent	
tension	
between	
data	
collection	
and	
personal	
privacy	
,	
organizations	
at	
the	
leading	
edge	
of	
human	
capital	
analytics	
(	
HCA	
)	
are	
leveraging	
new	
sources	
of	
workforce	
data	
to	
gain	
competitive	
advantage	
.	
Even	
companies	
that	
are	
less	
experienced	
with	
handling	
this	
next	
generation	
of	
HCA	
are	
turning	
to	
analytics	
to	
gain	
insights	
from	
“	
old	
”	
data	
readily	
available	
in	
their	
systems	
.	
Next	
-	
generation	
HCA	
enables	
leaders	
to	
gain	
real	
-	
time	
data	
about	
their	
workforce	
so	
they	
can	
take	
action	
quickly	
to	
meet	
the	
changing	
needs	
of	
the	
company	
.	
Insights	
gleaned	
from	
these	
sources	
can	
provide	
a	
more	
comprehensive	
view	
on	
workforce	
issues	
that	
impact	
business	
performance	
,	
helping	
to	
differentiate	
the	
“	
best	
from	
the	
rest	
.	
”	
Employers	
in	
Asia	
are	
now	
recognizing	
the	
value	
of	
HCA	
and	
how	
such	
data	
insights	
can	
aid	
business	
decisions	
.	
Asian	
firms	
,	
such	
as	
Citi	
India	
and	
HCL	
Technologies	
,	
are	
using	
mobile	
apps	
and	
social	
networking	
platforms	
to	
bring	
in	
talent	
.

Over	
time	
,	
there	
will	
be	
a	
widening	
performance	
gap	
between	
companies	
that	
excel	
at	
using	
new	
data	
sources	
and	
tools	
to	
optimize	
human	
capital	
and	
those	
that	
lag	
behind
